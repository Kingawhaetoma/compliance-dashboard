# Why I Built This

Most organizations use GRC tools to prepare for security audits such as SOC 2, HIPAA, and ISO 27001.

I built this project to simulate how cybersecurity teams:

• Track controls  
• Measure compliance  
• Prepare for audits  

This project demonstrates my skills in:

• Cybersecurity compliance concepts  
• Database design  
• Full-stack development  
• Risk and control tracking
